        The modern web revolution starts prioritising the importance of
        performance, scalability and developer experience. The term Jamstack
        starts to be adopted by a wider group of developers and the first
        enterprise Jamstack projects are announced.
      </TimelineItem>
      <Stem />
      <TimelineItem bg="blue" title="2018">
        Tools like Netlify, Gatsby and Contentful have helped promote the term
        and the community is rapidly growing. This was also the year of the
        first Jamstack Conference.

        The year that Jamstack went mainstream. An explosion of new tools and

        "JAMstack" becomes "Jamstack" and brought with it a new brand for the
        community. ZEIT becomes Vercel and begins blurring the lines of what
        Jamstack really means as Next.js grows in popularity, largely due to its
        ability to combine server-side and static rendering in the same site.

        While Jamstack continues to expand, confusion about what it really means
